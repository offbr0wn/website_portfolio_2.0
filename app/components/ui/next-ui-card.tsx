                Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shashank a software developer specializing in
                frontend development, who's bread and butter is react , I enjoy
                creating and designing things that live on the internet. My
                interest in web development started back in 2017 when I decided
                to try editing custom elements within websites, which lead me to
                explore the creative side of web design

                art of crafting exceptional digital experiences. As a developer,
                I thrive on turning lines of code into functional and elegant
                solutions. My goal is to not just create software, but to build
                digital marvels that seamlessly merge form and function. I
                believe that aesthetics and usability go hand in hand. My eye
                for awesome design ensures that every project I undertake not
                only works flawlessly under the hood but also looks stunning on
                the surface. Through this website, I aim to share my insights,
                experiences, and creations with you.

                self-driven, hard-working, fast learner and constantly seeking
                to improve my skills!
              </p>

                along with others when working in a group setting. I am
