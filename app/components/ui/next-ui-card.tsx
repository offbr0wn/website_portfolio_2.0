                Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Shashank a software developer specializing in
                frontend development, who's bread and butter is react and
                Typescript , I enjoy creating and designing things that live on
                the internet. My interest in web development started back in
                2017 when I decided to try editing custom elements within
                websites, which lead me to explore the creative side of web
                design

                Since the early days of my journey, I've been captivated by the
                art of crafting exceptional digital experiences. As a developer,
                I thrive on turning lines of code into functional and elegant
                solutions. My goal is to not just create software, but to build
                digital marvels that seamlessly merge form and function. I
                believe that aesthetics and usability go hand in hand. My eye
                for awesome design ensures that every project I undertake not
                only works flawlessly under the hood but also looks stunning on
                the surface.
              </p>

                I have the ability to adapt to any type of environment,and get
                along with others when working in a group setting. I am
                passionate about coding and solving problems through thinking
                outside the box ðŸ™‚.
